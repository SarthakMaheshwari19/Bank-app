# Bank-app

problem statement:
create a simple banking app using oops concept

description:
This Python code defines a bank account management system using object-oriented programming. It includes two classes: `BankAccount` and `SavingsAccount`. The `BankAccount` class serves as the base class with attributes such as account number, balance, name, phone, and transaction history. The `SavingsAccount` class inherits from `BankAccount` and adds functionality specific to a savings account, such as interest calculation, deposit, withdrawal, and transaction history display.

The code implements a menu-driven interface using a while loop where users can choose options like deposit, withdraw, display account balance, and view transaction history. It also calculates and adds interest to the savings account balance.

This bank app provides a simple yet functional system for managing a savings account, making it suitable for learning about basic banking operations and object-oriented programming concepts in Python.
